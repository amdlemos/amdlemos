## About Me 🧐

I'm an explorer of the world of technology and creativity, always seeking to learn and contribute to projects that share values of open source, innovation, and artistic expression. My journey has taken me through incredible paths, including the realms of Linux, GNU, street art, and more.

In addition to my technical interests, I'm a proud father to my beloved daughter, Amélia, and feel blessed to share life with my partner, Fernanda. Our family is completed by the loving and playful presence of our dogs, Barnabé 🐾 and Luneta 🐶.

## Interests 🌟

- **Open Source Projects:** I believe in the power of global collaboration and the democratization of knowledge. Contributing to open source projects not only allows me to learn from other talented developers but also helps me give back to the community that has given me so much.

- **Linux and GNU:** I'm a Linux enthusiast and advocate for free software. The freedom of customization and the GNU/Linux philosophy are aspects that attract me. I'm always excited to learn more about different distributions and tools.

- **Street Art:** Creativity is a fundamental part of my life, and street art is a form of expression that fascinates me. I admire how street artists can transform urban spaces and convey powerful messages through their art.
